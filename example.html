      <td>Tesla will stop selling cars once full self-driving is solved, says Elon Musk [Updated]</td>
      <td>2019-07-08 00:34:00</td>
      <td>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been talking a lot about Tesla Network lately, part of Tesla�s �Master Plan, Part Deux� which will enable Tesla cars with full self-driving hardware to operate as autonomous robotaxis to generate revenue for owners and for Tesla itself.\nThis is all still a ways off, but that hasn�t stopped Musk and others from theorizing about what might happen when the technological problems behind self-driving are solved. �Recently, Musk stated that any Tesla bought today is an �appreciating asset� due to its potential to be used to generate revenue in the future. �But an asset wouldn�t really appreciate unless a new, similar asset couldn�t be bought at the same price. �So now, Musk has committed to making that happen, stating that once robotaxis become possible, Tesla will likely stop selling cars to consumers, at least at the same price.</td>
