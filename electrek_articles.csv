2019-11-27 14:06:00,Review: Jeda USB Hub – a must-have accessory for the Tesla Model 3 [Video],"The Jeda USB Hub is one of the best accessories available for the Tesla Model 3. A simple device, it turns the two USB ports in the center console into five USB ports — three USB-A ports and two USB-C ports.The added connectivity is nice by itself, as it allows you to connect more accessories to the Model 3 via the vehicle’s center console. But it’s the hidden compartment that allows you to neatly tuck away an SSD or USB flash drive that makes the Jeda USB Hub special. Watch our hands-on video walkthrough for the details.

2019-11-27 13:20:00,New York legislature delivers Right-to-Charge law to Gov. Cuomo (Thanks Elon?),"Back in June, New York’s legislature – the State Assembly & State Senate – passed a “Right-to-Charge” bill, which would prohibit condominiums, home-owners associations (HOAs) and the like from unreasonably restricting the installation of electric vehicle charging stations. The bill, however, sat there until yesterday, when it was finally delivered to the Governor for his signature. Also yesterday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded on Twitter offering to help New York Times best-selling author Nnedi Okorafor. Ms. Okorafor had tweeted on November 1 that her HOA had turned down her request. Coincidence or not, New Yorkers shouldn’t rejoice quite yet. Under New York rules, because the legislature is not currently in session, if Governor Andrew Cuomo fails to sign the bill in the next 29 days, the effect is the same as if he vetoed the bill.

Both are Democrats, and both are apparently receptive to the fossil fuel industry’s push for special taxes on electric vehicles. Update: the discussion begins at the 11:20 minute mark here. Not good. Eric Blomgren of the New Jersey Gasoline & Convenience Store Association and Michael Egenton of the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce testify, pushing hard for the tax and slowing EV adoption. Jeff Tittel, Director of New Jersey Sierra Club, appears alone to defend EV drivers. He’s outnumbered and the bill continues its menacing march forward.
